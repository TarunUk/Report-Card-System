# Report Card System

This is a basic project using C++, Python, and HTML.  
The C++ program takes student name and marks as input and saves them to a text file.  
The Python script reads the file, calculates average marks, assigns a grade, and generates an HTML report.  
Finally, the report is opened in a browser to view the student’s performance.  
It’s a simple and beginner-friendly system for learning file handling and automation.
